A /teams page and corresponding /teams GET endpoint
Show all the teams
A /roster/:id page and corresponding /roster/:id GET endpoint
Show all the players in a team
A /players page and corresponding /players GET endpoint
Show all the players

Things you've started but haven't finished

A /players/:id page with no endpoint
Create an enpoint that has a SQL query that selects a single players information
This page needs to useParams (like you've done elsewhere)
Call that endpoint on the page using the id param

Thing to add

A page with a form that calls a post end point
The simplest version of this could literally be discussion, so just content and username
A more complex version would be to have a games table where users can add games, and scores
